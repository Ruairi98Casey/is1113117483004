        <p class="b"><rc>Hello, my name is Ruairi Casey. I am 19 years old and I live in Cork with my family. In my opinion I am 
        a friendly and outgoing person who never shys away from hard work. I am currently a first year student, studying Business Information Systems
        in University College of Cork. The main reason why I decided to study BIS at UCC was because I have a keen interest in both business and computers.
        I also was aware of the many fantastic job opportunities that are offered when you complete your degree.</p>
        <p class="b">I have many hobbies such as socialising with friends, attending concerts as often as I can and without doubt sports. I enjoy all sports but my
        favourite is athletics (or more specifically running!). I have been a member of Togher Athletics since the young age of 10 and I have no 
        aspirations to move somewhere else anytime soon! I compete in both cross country (6k) and track and field (800m & 1500m) races and occasionally
        I manage to grab a medal!</p>
        <p class="b">That's just a small bit of information about myself to let you know a small bit about me. Thanks for taking your time to read this and 
        I sincerely hope you enjoy my project!</rc></p>
